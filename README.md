Tupple Dice README

To run the Tupple Game:
run the follwing command in terminal: python tupplegame.py

Rules of the Game:
You will be presented an option to play against any number of players, please enter a real number greater than 1, or you can play a single player game against a simple computer by selecting "C"
Once you start playing Three Die will be rolled for each player to start.  The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible each round to reach a total score of 50.  
Points are scored based on the face value of all dice.  A round ends when the player either choses to score thier dice, or if they get three of one kind of dice (which will result in the end of the round with zero points).  
If opting to re-roll, paired dice will be locked in and cannot be rerolled, so the only choice a player will have it to roll the non-matching die.  
If none of the dice match, the player enters the dice they would like to reroll (labeled in order 1,2, and 3).
